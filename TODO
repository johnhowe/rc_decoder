Requirements:
1. Use interrupts
2. Use a ring buffer

Driver:
1. Setup a skeleton kernel driver
2. Adapt this driver
3. Read from IO
4. Interrupt from IO (GPIO_157 - BB expansion 22)
5. Timestamp using system tick counter (is this fast enough?)
6. Add rate of change to each channel
7. Autodetect number of channels

Application:
1. Read driver and output current values
2.
